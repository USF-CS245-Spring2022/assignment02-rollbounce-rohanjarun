# RollBounce

This is a working starting point for a bouncing ball simulation in Java Swing / AWT. (When you compile and run this, you'll see two animated balls moving horizontally at different speeds. You may use this as the starting point to meet the assignment objective.)

There are many online tutorials for implementing 2-dimensional animations in Java. Here are two:

Details of this assignment are provided separately.

For this assignment I relied on 3 main resources
My Lab06 for the linked list
The 2 websites used in the Assignment file 
Peer answers on Campus Wire

The hardest part of the assignment was saving the ball in a linked list and making it bounce. I'd say the easiest part was to make the ball thanks to the help of the resources which were given on the Assignment 2 file.
